# ADR-001: Use Babylon.js for 3D Rendering

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to create a 3D windmill visualization for our web application. The project requires:
- Real-time 3D rendering in the browser
- Animation capabilities for windmill rotation
- Good performance across different devices
- Ease of development and maintenance

## Decision
We will use Babylon.js as our 3D rendering engine.

## Consequences

### What becomes easier
- Rich 3D rendering capabilities out of the box
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Built-in animation system for windmill rotation
- WebGL abstraction simplifies development
- Good performance optimization features
- TypeScript support for better development experience

### What becomes harder
- Additional learning curve for team members unfamiliar with 3D graphics
- Larger bundle size compared to 2D-only solutions
- More complex debugging for 3D-specific issues
- Dependency on external library for core functionality

## Alternatives Considered

### Three.js
- **Pros**: Most popular 3D library, extensive ecosystem
- **Cons**: Less beginner-friendly, more manual setup required
- **Why not chosen**: Babylon.js provides better out-of-the-box experience

### Custom WebGL
- **Pros**: Maximum control and minimal dependencies
- **Cons**: Extremely time-consuming, high complexity
- **Why not chosen**: Not cost-effective for project scope

### 2D Canvas/SVG Animation
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, smaller bundle
- **Cons**: Limited visual appeal, no true 3D perspective
- **Why not chosen**: Doesn't meet visual requirements

## Related Decisions
- Future ADR needed for specific windmill modeling approach
- Future ADR needed for animation and interaction patterns
